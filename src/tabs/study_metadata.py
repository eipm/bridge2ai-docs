    Biospecimens Description<br>
    The Bridge2AI-Voice dataset contains samples from conventional acoustic tasks including respiratory sounds, cough sounds, and free speech prompts, capturing voice, speech and language data relating to health. Participants who consent are asked to perform speaking tasks and complete self-reported demographic and medical history questionnaires, as well as disease-specific validated questionnaires. Participants who consent also permit investigators to access medical information through EHR platforms in order to perform gold standard validation of diagnoses and symptoms

    Study Population<br>
    The current v.1.0.0 dataset contains only adult populations. As the study progresses, a pediatric cohort will be introduced. Inclusion/exclusion criteria and additional information regarding the dataset and study metadata will be updated at that time. In addition, the current dataset contains fluent English speakers but will expand to include data collection in Spanish.
